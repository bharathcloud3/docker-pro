Certainly! Below is a simple example of a Python web application using Flask. Create a file named `app.py` in the same directory as your Dockerfile and add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask

# Create a Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, Dockerized Flask App!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

This code does the following:

- Imports the Flask class from the `flask` module.
  
- Creates a new Flask web application instance.
  
- Defines a route `/` that returns a simple message "Hello, Dockerized Flask App!".
  
- Starts the Flask web server if the script is executed directly.

Make sure to create a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory to list the Flask dependency:

```
Flask==2.0.2
```

Your directory structure should look something like this:

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── app.py
└── requirements.txt
```

With these files in place, you can build and run your Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image:
    ```
    docker build -t my-python-web-app .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:
    ```
    docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-web-app
    ```

Now, you should be able to access your Flask web application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. You should see the message "Hello, Dockerized Flask App!" displayed on the webpage.

It seems like there might be a compatibility issue between the Flask version and the Werkzeug version installed in the Docker container. The error suggests that Flask is unable to import `url_quote` from Werkzeug.

To fix this issue, you can specify the exact versions of Flask and Werkzeug in your `requirements.txt` file to ensure compatibility. Update your `requirements.txt` to include the specific versions:

```
Flask==2.0.2
Werkzeug==2.0.2
```

After updating the `requirements.txt` file, rebuild your Docker image and run the container again:

1. Build the Docker image:
    ```
    docker build -t my-python-web-app .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:
    ```
    docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-web-app
    ```

This should resolve the import error, and your Flask application should now run without any issues inside the Docker container.
